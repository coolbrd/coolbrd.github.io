# Privacy Policy for SaidIt

Last Updated: 08/03/2023

SaidIt is a utility and productivity tool designed for personal use. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application on Android and iOS platforms. By using SaidIt, you agree to the terms and practices described in this policy.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect any personally identifiable information from our users. The only data we collect is a unique account sign-in token, which is used solely to track your premium status and provide access to premium features. We do not have access to or store any personal details such as your name, email address, or any other identifying information.

## Recording and Audio Data

SaidIt allows you to record a rolling replay buffer of the last few minutes of audio. This audio is stored in-memory on your device and is automatically deleted when you either start a new recording or close the app. The audio is not saved permanently unless you explicitly press the save button within the app. Once you save the audio, it is stored locally on your device in the app's encrypted local storage directory. We do not have access to any audio data saved on your device, and it remains strictly private and inaccessible to other apps on both Android and iOS platforms.

## Third-party Services

SaidIt does not integrate any third-party services, including analytics or advertisements. We are committed to maintaining a clean and ad-free user experience while respecting your privacy.

## Data Security

We take data security seriously. All data collected and stored within SaidIt is protected using industry-standard encryption measures. Your account sign-in token and any locally saved audio are kept secure and safeguarded from unauthorized access.

## Children's Privacy

SaidIt is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to promptly remove such data from our records.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document, and the date of the latest revision will be mentioned at the beginning of the policy.
